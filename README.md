## Introduction

Hello, my name is Mallory Tompsett, and thank you for viewing my Neighborhood Map React application. I hope that you enjoy my single-page app that displays the top 15 coffee shops located in my current hometown of San Antonio, Texas - offically known as the Home of the Alamo! Enjoy exploring my application, and I hope that you will find some amazing local coffee shops (Local Coffee is one of my favorites!) to try next time you visit the Alamo City! Note that the addresses listed in the InfoWindows (when applicable) comes from the FourSquare API, and not from the Google Maps API. Also, please see the references that I used for my project in the comment at the bottom of my [App.js](./src/app.js) file.

## Instructions

Please click on the 'neighborhood-map' folder to take you into my project, as the main part of my project is located there. There is also a main README file stored in the folder with the rest of my project that explains more about my project.Thank you for viewing my project, and enjoy!
