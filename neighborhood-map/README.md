## Introduction

Hello, my name is Mallory Tompsett, and thank you for viewing my Neighborhood Map React application. I hope that you enjoy my single-page app that displays the top 15 coffee shops located in my current hometown of San Antonio, Texas - offically known as the Home of the Alamo! Enjoy exploring my application, and I hope that you will find some amazing local coffee shops (Local Coffee is one of my favorites!) to try next time you visit the Alamo City! Note that the addresses listed in the InfoWindows (when applicable) comes from the FourSquare API, and not from the Google Maps API. Also, please see the references that I used for my project in the comment at the bottom of my [App.js](./src/app.js) file.

## Instructions

Running my app on you local machine is actually pretty easy, though there are a few steps that you will need to follow in your CLI/Terminal application:
 1) First of all, make sure that you have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer. If you need assistance with doing this, please see the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) web sites, respectively.
 2) Next, clone my project repo via `git`, or you may download my project to your computer using zip.
 3) Back in your Terminal/CLI program, navigate your way to the root directory of my project - in this case, `neighborhood-maps`.
 4) Run the command `npm install` in your Terminal/CLI program.
 5) Finallly, run the command `npm start` in your Terminal/CLI program. That should open up a `localhost:30000` window in your default browser, though you may need to do it yourself if it doesn't do it automatically. Enjoy!
